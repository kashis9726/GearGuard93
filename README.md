🔧 GearGuard – Maintenance Tracker (Project Overview)
🧠 Problem We Are Solving

In many organizations, equipment maintenance is handled informally.
Breakdowns are reported late, responsibilities are unclear, and maintenance history is lost.
This leads to delays, poor tracking, and inefficient repairs.

🎯 Our Goal

To build a simple maintenance management system that connects:

Equipment (what needs maintenance)

Teams (who will fix it)

Requests (what work needs to be done)

💡 Our Solution – GearGuard

GearGuard is a centralized web application that helps manage equipment and maintenance work in a structured way.

All equipment is registered with its details and assigned maintenance team

Users can raise maintenance requests for:

Breakdowns (Corrective)

Routine checkups (Preventive)

Requests move through clear stages:
New → In Progress → Repaired / Scrap

Preventive tasks appear on a calendar

Technicians track work using a Kanban board

All data is handled using real-time backend APIs and a database, not static JSON files.

✅ Key Highlights

Real-time data using APIs

Automatic team assignment based on equipment

Visual tracking with Kanban & Calendar views

Clear responsibility and maintenance history

Clean and simple user flow
